                <label><b>Destination: </b>Ema is a vibrant and friendly Bichon who has been under our care at the shelter. We prioritize the health and well-being of all our furry residents, including Ema. Upon arrival, Ema underwent a comprehensive health assessment to ensure she receives the best possible care during her stay.

                    Ema's health in the shelter is closely monitored by our dedicated veterinary team. She receives regular check-ups, vaccinations, and any necessary treatments to maintain her optimal health. Our shelter provides a safe and clean environment, nutritious meals, and plenty of exercise and socialization opportunities for Ema to thrive.
                    
                    We also focus on preventive healthcare measures, including flea and tick prevention, dental care, and grooming sessions to keep Ema looking and feeling her best. Our goal is to ensure that Ema and all our shelter dogs are healthy, happy, and ready to find their forever homes.
                    
                    If you're interested in providing a loving home for Ema or learning more about her, please don't hesitate to contact us. Your support and care make a significant difference in the lives of dogs like Ema.</label>
